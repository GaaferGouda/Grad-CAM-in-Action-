#  Brain Tumor Detection with Grad-CAM

A simple deep learning project for **brain tumor classification and visualization** using **Grad-CAM**.

##  Overview
This model detects brain tumors from MRI scans and shows **where** the model focused using **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)**.

##  Features
- Brain tumor image classification  
- Grad-CAM heatmap visualization  
- Easy to use and modify

##  Usage
1. Upload an MRI image  
2. The model predicts if a tumor is present  
3. Grad-CAM highlights the key regions

##  Tools
Python • TensorFlow • OpenCV • Matplotlib

##  Purpose
To make AI in medical imaging **more explainable and trustworthy**.
